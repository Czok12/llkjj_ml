# LLKJJ ML Pipeline - German Invoice Processing
> AI-powered document processing pipeline for German electrical contractor invoices using Docling, Gemini, and spaCy NLP. Consolidated KISS architecture with SKR03 accounting classification.

## Core Services
- [Unified Processor](./unified_processor.py): Main PDF processing pipeline with Docling OCR, Gemini enhancement, and SKR03 classification
- [Training Service](./training_service.py): spaCy NER model training and data export for German electrical terminology
- [Main CLI](./main.py): Unified command-line interface for all operations

## Processing Commands
- [Process PDFs](./main.py): Extract structured data from German electrical invoices
- [Export Training Data](./main.py): Convert processed documents to spaCy training format
- [Train Models](./main.py): Train German NER models for electrical contractor entities
- [Complete Pipeline](./main.py): End-to-end PDF processing and model training workflow

## Configuration & Setup
- [Configuration](./src/config.py): Central configuration management for paths, models, and API keys
- [Environment Setup](./.env.example): Required environment variables and API configurations
- [Dependencies](./pyproject.toml): Poetry dependency management with Python 3.10+ requirements

## Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](./CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md): Post-consolidation architecture and KISS principles
- [Project README](./README.md): Quick start guide and usage examples
- [AI Instructions](./.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md): AI assistant guidelines and best practices

## Development

- [Tests](./tests/): Unit and integration tests for core functionality

## German Electrical Industry Context
- **SKR03 Classification**: German standard chart of accounts for electrical contractors
- **Domain Entities**: Rechnung (invoice), Artikel (item), Menge (quantity), Einzelpreis (unit price)
- **Language Optimization**: German text processing with spaCy de_core_news_sm model
- **Quality Scoring**: Confidence metrics for extraction and classification accuracy

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.10+**: Modern type hints and async support
- **Docling 2.44.0**: IBM's PDF processing with TableFormer AI
- **spaCy 3.7+**: German NLP and named entity recognition
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: LLM enhancement for extraction quality
- **Poetry**: Dependency management and CLI tooling
