# User Memory

## User Preferences
- Programming languages: Python
- Code style preferences: Use type annotations, follow PEP 484, fix mypy errors
- Development environment: VS Code, macOS, zsh
- Communication style: Concise, step-by-step, progress updates

## Project Context
- Current project type: Python ML pipeline and extraction toolkit
- Tech stack: Python, spaCy, custom extractors, mypy for type checking
- Architecture patterns: Modular, src/ structure, config-driven
- Key requirements: Type safety, mypy compliance, maintainability

## Coding Patterns
- Use explicit type annotations
- Fix all mypy errors
- Prefer PEP 484 and Context7 best practices
- Document fixes in memory

## Context7 Research History
- None yet (will update after research)

## Conversation History
- Task: Fix mypy errors and missing stubs in 15 files (113 errors)
- Plan: Research, analyze, fix incrementally, test, update memory

## Notes
- Start with type annotation and stub errors, then address assignment and attribute errors
- Update memory after each major step
